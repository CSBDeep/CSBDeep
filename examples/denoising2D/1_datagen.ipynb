    "\n",
    "The high SNR images are acquistions of Human U2OS cells taken from the [Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection](https://data.broadinstitute.org/bbbc/BBBC006/) and the low SNR images were created by synthetically adding *strong read-out and shot-noise* (and additionally applying *pixel binning* of 2x2) thus mimicking acquisitions at a very low light level.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Each image pair should be registered, which in a real application setting is best achieved by acquiring both stacks _interleaved_, i.e. as different channels that correspond to the different exposure/laser settings. \n",
